## Description 📝

This is my personal portfolio, developed with a focus on simplicity, performance, and organization. 
The project was built using only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of external frameworks or libraries.
The site presents information about me, my contact details, academic background, courses taken, technologies I use, and projects developed.
